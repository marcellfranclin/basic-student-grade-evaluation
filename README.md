# basic-student-grade-evaluation

## Background Problem
This notebook was created to evaluate student grades based on manual input such as name, student ID, and exam score. It serves as a beginner-friendly exercise to understand the basics of variables, input/output, and conditional logic in Python.

## Insights
- Using input() to collect user data.
- Working with variables to store and manage data.
- Implementing conditional logic (if-elif-else) to classify scores.
- Understanding data types (string and integer).
- Formatting and displaying evaluation results clearly.

## Advice
- Consider adding input validation to prevent errors when incorrect data types are entered (e.g., letters in the score input).
- This project could be extended into a GUI or simple web app using tkinter or Flask.
- It's also a solid foundation for building a more advanced grading system with data storage features.
